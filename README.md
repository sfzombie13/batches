windows batch files

I wrote some of these myself.  Others were given to me.  Some were taken from the internet.  The ones taken will be placed
inside another folder.  These may be used, it is the intenet after all and most likely the way they ended up here, but the
license covering the repo may or may not apply to these scripts.  The ones given to me were given from a county school 
office so fall under public domain.  These I am leaving with my own because I forgot which ones they all were anyway.

I uploaded a picture to try to redefine the word hacker since I am tired of being associated with criminals.  Feel free to 
reproduce the definition on stickers, hats, t-shirts, or any other type of print, with or without credit.  You may take off
the h@ck-creation part and the part about codewv.org, but the definition must remain intact:  hacker - one who makes, modifies, or 
improves things.
